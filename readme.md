# Simple React Boilerplate

This is a very simple app set-up that gets you up and running with React! It comes set up with:

- Webpack, to set up a localhost server
- Babel, for compiling ES6 and React code to be compatible for all browsers
- A Sass compiler, for writing nicer stylesheets
- (Foundation)[http://foundation.zurb.com/], for easy styling
- React and ReactDOM, of course, for writing React of course!

## How to use

### Downloading and configuring

Download the project:

```
git clone <clone_url>
```
Open `package.json` and edit the name listed on line 2 to match the name of your app.

Open `build/index.html` and update the title of the site, on line 5.

In your terminal window, run `npm install`

### Running and viewing the project

To view the project in your browser, run `npm start`.

Open (http://localhost:8080)[http://localhost:8080] in your browser to view the project!

### Updating the project

Add new React components to `src/components`. Currently, `src/components/App.js` is being loaded and rendered - update the contents of that component to start changing the rendered view!
